# Calendar
## Project 2

Test File - driver.cpp written by my professor Steven H. Gold 

The Calendar program should be able to take in a month, day, and year.
That date can be converted from Gregorian to Julian calendar and vice versa.
Other actions:
* Increment date by N days 
* Decrement date by N days
* Add one month to date
* Return the number of days between this date and date D
* Return day of the year
* Return day according to day of the week
